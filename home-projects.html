                  Our master bathroom was never something to write home about. It had this weird, awkward waiting room thing with some horrible wallpaper border (that was applied over an older wallpaper border).
                  The paint was off yellow and sponged on over, you guessed it, wallpaper. We didn't want to repaint over the yellow color,
                  since the wallpaper below it was starting to bubble a bit. So, naturally we decided to just demo the whole thing. Just rip it all out.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-20 font-20 lh-15">
                  Also, the bathroom portion (to the left of the vanity/mirror thing) was very cramped and had some nice
                  90s glass blocks. There were a lot of bad wall patches in there... The shower was dirty and smelled 
                  a little mildewy... definitely not cute. I'd say it was last remodeled about 20 or so years ago. It's time had come.
                </p>

                  <p class="font-20 lh-15">
                    In a previous life, I was a handy man/contractor guy that remodeled and fixed just about everything. So I was quite excited to take on a project 
                    in our own house!
                  </p>
                  <p class="mt-20 font-20 lh-15">
                    Like any project hungry, new homeowner, my wife and I started knocking out walls and ripping up carpet. We took out the door between the 
                    waiting room area and the bathroom and chiselled out the glass blocks from around the shower. It took us about 5 or so nights,
                    but eventually we got everything out.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mt-20 font-20 lh-15">
                    Oh, and behind that vanity was some pretty sweet, old wallpaper. We're pretty sure it was original to the house, which is always an exciting find. 
                    There's something about finding an original feature on an older home that is so thrilling; it's like a small time machine taking us back 50 years - showing 
                    us what someone else saw everyday. We peeled off a square of it and saved it - we might frame a small bit of it and hang it back up, but for now it's 
                    collecting dust somewhere in our closet ðŸ˜‰
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div class="w-100p flex justify-space-between mt-20 sm-flex-col">
                <img src="assets/bathroom_6.png" class="w-300px b-2 b-radius-5 light-shadow sm-mb-10" loading="lazy" />
                <img src="assets/bathroom_7.png" class="w-300px b-2 b-radius-5 light-shadow sm-mb-10" loading="lazy" />
                <div class="w-300px">
                  <p class="font-20 lh-15">
                    Finally we emptied out the whole bathroom, which at this point resembled more of a closet than a bathroom.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mt-20 font-20 lh-15">
                    Also, in this picture you can kind of see how our bathroom was laid out. We had a shower on the left, then a sink 
                    in the middle, and a toilet next to the window. It was all crammed in a 7 foot by 4 foot room.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div class="mt-20">
                <p class="font-20 lh-15">
                  Our plan was to expand the shower by just a bit, move the sink to where that vanity with the mirror was, and push the toilet into the 
                  room by just a bit. With this layout you would enter the bathroom from our bedroom and immediately see the sink/vanity and then
                  to the left you'd see our shower and the toilet in the corner by the window. It doesn't make for a super glamorous bathroom, but it
                  does create a more efficiant use of the space. 
                </p>
                <p class="mt-20 font-20 lh-15">
                  Also around this time my parents came to help us. I took a week off of work and both my parents magically had a week off at that time as well,
                  so they drove 5 hours to our house. We tried to get as much done in that week as possible!
                <p>
              </div>
              <div class="w-100p flex justify-space-between mt-20 sm-flex-col">
                <img src="assets/bathroom_8.png" class="w-300px h-400px b-2 b-radius-5 light-shadow sm-mb-10" loading="lazy" />

                <p class="w-300px font-20 lh-15">
                  With the room emptied, we could finally see exactly what we were working with. The floor around the shower was 
                  rotting and weak so we removed that, and we took out the ceiling to 1) replace it with new drywall since we removed a wall
                  and 2) put in an exhaust fan and reposition the HVAC for the room. This was one of the suckier parts because it was the 
                  middle of august and the attic was HOT. Also, we had to bag up and respread all of the blown-in insulation....not fun.
                </p>

              <div class="mt-20">
                <p class="font-20 lh-15">
                  At this point, the bathroom had half a floor and no ceiling. But it didn't last long, we 
                  soon had everything patched up.
